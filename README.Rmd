The goal of ussie is to make working with European league football data
easier through cleaning and manipulation functions that tidy the data set
from the **`engsoccerdata`** package (Curley 2016).

## Installation

You can install the development version of ussie from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stevespangler/ussie")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ussie)
## produce cleaned, standardized league data set
england_data <- uss_make_matches(engsoccerdata::england, "England")

```
